in 2025, i was reading a book on an app that had a feature where you could click on lines of text to view thoughts left by other readers. there was one particular comment that stuck with me - it was about the disparity between our verbal language, mental thoughts, and physical actions, which can never be truly reconciled. the original comment was in chinese; its poetic (and un-ironic?) that i cant do it justice in english. i like the analogy of our thoughts and feelings being raw tomatoes, and language acts as the blender that turns them into consumable tomato juice (not that raw tomatoes can't be eaten, maybe this is a bad analogy). what i'm trying to say is: i think it's inevitable that certain thoughts lose their essence when we try to convey them to others?

i have so many silly little thoughts to share, but not being “articulate” enough has always been one of my biggest frustrations in life. i have a friend who could always accurately describe indescribable feelings i had, then surprise me with new thoughts i had never considered. i wish i could be articulate like them. this site will hopefully be my valiant attempt to practice!
